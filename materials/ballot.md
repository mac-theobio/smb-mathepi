Dear mathepi subgroup members:

We are pleased to announce an excellent slate of candidates for the open position on our governing committee.

* [Zhilan Feng, Purdue University](https://www.math.purdue.edu/people/bio/zfeng/home)
* [Gabriela Gomes, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/gomez.gabriela)
* [Abba Gumel, Arizona State University](https://math.la.asu.edu/~gumel/)
* [Jane Heffernan, York University](http://immune.math.yorku.ca/jmheffer/)
* [Seyed Moghadas, York University](http://math.yorku.ca/~moghadas/)

You are a voting member of the group if you are a current member of the SMB and have expressed (or are willing to express) interest in our subgroup.

Due to circumstances that we failed to control, the voting will take place on a very tight timeline. It will be done by instant runoff voting on email ballots.

Please vote (if you are a voting member) by emailing an ordered list of 1-5 candidates (most preferred candidate at the top) to mathepi.elections@gmail.com. We will treat your ballots as strictly confidential, and will attempt to avoid seeing who you voted for at all.

We will accept ballots until Wed 11 Jul at Noon Toronto time (Thu 2 AM Sydney time).

We will evaluate the votes using Condorcet methods at https://www.condorcet.vote. If the methods provide differing winners, that will be super-interesting (and we will use the winner provided by the "Schulze winning" algorithm).

Jonathan Dushoff and David Earn
