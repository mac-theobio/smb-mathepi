Dear mathepi subgroup members:

We are pleased to announce an excellent slate of candidates for the open position on our governing committee.

* David Champredon
* Carrie Manore
* Other people

You are a voting member of the group if you are a current member of the SMB and have expressed (or are willing to express) interest in our subgroup.

We are soliciting email ballots which will be counted by an instant runoff voting algorithm.

Please vote (if you are a voting member) by emailing an ordered list of 1-4 candidates (most preferred candidate at the top) to mathepi.elections@gmail.com. We will treat your ballots as strictly confidential, and will attempt to avoid seeing who you voted for at all.

We will accept ballots until XXX at Noon Toronto time.

We will evaluate the votes using Condorcet methods at https://www.condorcet.vote. If the methods provide differing winners, that will be super-interesting (and we will use the winner provided by the “Schulze winning” algorithm).

The governing committee

David Earn, Chair  
Zhilan Feng, Secretary and incoming chair  
Jonathan Dushoff, Previous chair
